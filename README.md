# reinforcement-learning-project
A final project that my partner and I did for the Reinforcment Learning course in the University of Groningen. 


An agent is trained to solve the "FrozenLake-v1", Toy Text environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent was trained using Q-Learning and SARSA. These learning algorithms were used in conjunction with the following exploration strategies:  greedy, $\epsilon$-greedy, action preferences, and upper-confidence bound (UCB). Using a random agent as a baseline, these learning algorithms and exploration strategies were compared. The results convey the average reward per episode and indicate that learning is achieved.
